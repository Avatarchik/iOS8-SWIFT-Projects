iOS 8 Apps done in SWIFT for a online class I took ages and ages ago. 

Mostly broken now, since SWIFT2 isn't fully backward compatible. However I plan/hope to revisit some of these and get them working again.

Google Blog Reader and Tinder-Clone are replicas of existing apps, RigFlip and FJ Beta are original apps.
